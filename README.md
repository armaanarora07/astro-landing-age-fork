### Built-in Automations

Landstro eliminates hours of tedious setup work with powerful built-in automations:

- **Database Setup**: Automatic SQLite initialization for contact forms and waitlist storage
- **Image Optimization**: All images are automatically compressed and converted to modern formats
- **Favicon Generation**: Complete favicon sets are created from your single logo file
- **Sitemap Creation**: SEO-friendly XML sitemap is generated during build
- **Security Headers**: Proper security configurations are automatically applied
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: All components are automatically responsive without extra work

These automations happen automatically during the build process (`npm run build`), saving you countless hours of configuration and optimization work that would normally be required when setting up a professional landing page.

For deployment, the `npm run prepare-prod` command creates a complete production build with all required files:

## Getting Started: Technical Setup

### Initial Installation

1. **Use the Landstro Template**:
   - Click the `Use this template` button in the GitHub repository
   - Create a repository using Landstro as your template
   - Clone your new repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
   cd yourrepo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Add your logo**:
   - Create a `logo.png` file with your company logo
   - Place it in `public/images/icon/logo.png`
   - This logo will be used to generate all favicons and site branding
   - **Recommendation**: Use a square logo with at least 512√ó512px dimensions

### Creating Environment Variables

1. **Copy the example environment file**:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. **Update required settings**:
   ```env
   # Application Settings (Required)

## Customization Guide

### Automatic Customizations

The build process automatically handles several customizations based on your `.env` settings:

1. **Company Name and Branding**: Set via environment variables:
   - `APP_NAME` - Updates the navbar brand name and SEO metadata site name
   - `COMPANY_TAGLINE` - Updates the main headline in the hero section
   - Various references throughout the site use these values

2. **Social Media Links**: Set via environment variables to appear in the navbar and footer:
   - Each platform will only be displayed if a URL is provided
   - Omitting or leaving empty any platform will hide its icon
   - Supported platforms: `TWITTER_URL`, `LINKEDIN_URL`, `GITHUB_URL`, `FACEBOOK_URL`, `INSTAGRAM_URL`

3. **UI Components**: Control which components are displayed:
   - `ENABLE_NAVBAR=false` - Hide the full navigation bar but still show the logo/brand in the top-left corner
   - Other feature flags can control additional components

4. **Email Settings**: Set via Postmark API keys and notification emails in `.env` - these configure form submissions

5. **Pricing Tables**: Customized via environment variables:
   - Set pricing with `PRICE_BASIC`, `PRICE_PRO`, and `PRICE_ENTERPRISE`
   - Use "FREE" to display a free tier (e.g., `PRICE_BASIC=FREE`)
   - Leave empty or omit variables to show "Contact Us" instead of a price
   - Customize tier names with `BASIC_TIER_NAME`, `PRO_TIER_NAME`, and `ENTERPRISE_TIER_NAME`

6. **Favicons**: Automatically generated from your logo.png during build

7. **Database**: Automatically initialized with proper tables for waitlist/contact forms

### Essential Files to Modify

1. **Branding & Logo**:
   - Replace `public/images/icon/logo.png` with your own logo (a square PNG, at least 512√ó512px)
   - Remove or replace company logos in `public/images/companies/` with your own partners/clients
   - All optimized images and favicons will be regenerated automatically when source images change

2. **Content Sections** (Manual Updates Required):
   - Hero section: `src/components/Hero.astro` (update headlines, descriptions, CTAs)
   - Benefits/features: `src/components/Benefits.astro` (update your product features)
   - Pricing: `src/components/Pricing.astro` (update tiers and pricing)
   - FAQ: `src/components/FAQ.astro` (update questions and answers)
   - Call to action: `src/components/CTA.astro` (update to match your value proposition)
   - Footer: `src/components/Footer.astro` (update copyright and additional links)

3. **Environment Variables** (Critical Configuration):
   - Update your `.env` file with all necessary values (see [Environment Variables](#creating-environment-variables) section)
   
4. **SEO & Metadata**:
   - Edit `src/layouts/Layout.astro` to update JSON-LD structured data (manually)
   - Meta keywords tag in `src/components/SEOMetadata.astro` should be updated manually

### Advanced Customization

- **Colors & Theme**: Edit the color scheme in `tailwind.config.mjs`
- **Typography**: Modify font settings in `tailwind.config.mjs`
- **Layout**: Adjust container widths and spacing in relevant component files
- **Astro Config**: Modify `astro.config.mjs` to adjust site settings, integrations, and image optimization
- **Custom Components**: Create your own components in the `src/components` directory and import them in your pages:
  ```astro
  ---
  // src/components/YourCustomComponent.astro
  const { title, description } = Astro.props;
  ---
  
  <div class="my-custom-component">
    <h2>{title}</h2>
    <p>{description}</p>
  </div>
  ```
  
  Then use it in any page:
  ```astro
  ---
  import YourCustomComponent from '../components/YourCustomComponent.astro';
  ---
  
  <YourCustomComponent title="Custom Feature" description="This is my custom component" />
  ```
- **Extending Existing Components**: You can extend existing components by copying them to a new file and modifying as needed, or by using Astro's slot system for composition
- **Deployment Variables**: Set `MAINTAINER` and `CREATOR` in the `.env` file to customize deployment information in Docker configurations

## Setting Up External Services

### Domain Management

#### Recommended Domain Types

- **Use**: `.com`, `.io`, `.ai`, `.dev`, or regional TLDs (`.co.uk`, `.de`, etc.)
- **Avoid**: Lesser-known TLDs like `.xyz`, `.online`, `.site` or even `.net` which can appear less professional

#### Domain Name Best Practices

- **Keep it short**: Ideally under 15 characters
- **Make it memorable**: Easy to spell and pronounce
- **Avoid hyphens**: They reduce memorability and trustworthiness
- **Check availability**: Ensure matching social media handles are available

#### Purchasing Process

1. Visit [Namecheap](namecheap.pxf.io/bO5rQv) or your preferred registrar
2. Search for your desired domain name
3. Purchase for 1-2 years
4. Enable privacy protection to hide your personal information

### Email Communication with [Postmark](https://www.postmarkapp.com/?via=9f893f)

This step is optional (and requires a work email). If you don't pass a Postmark key to `Landstro`, it will just store the emails in the database without sending notifications. You can also change the implementation for your preferred email sending provider.

1. **Create a Postmark account**:
   - Sign up at [Postmark](https://www.postmarkapp.com/?via=9f893f)
   - Verify your domain ownership through DNS records

2. **Create a new server in Postmark**:
   - Name it after your website/project
   - Configure sender signatures for your domain

3. **Get your API keys**:
   - Navigate to "API Tokens" in your server settings
   - Copy the Server API token
   - Note: Keep this key private; never commit it to public repositories

4. **Configure DKIM and SPF records**:
   - Follow Postmark's instructions to add DNS records
   - This improves email deliverability and prevents spam flags

### Analytics with Google

1. **Create a Google Analytics 4 account**:
   - Visit [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
   - Click "Start measuring" and follow the setup process

2. **Create a property for your website**:
   - Name it after your domain
   - Set the reporting time zone appropriately

3. **Set up a data stream**:
   - Choose "Web" as the platform
   - Enter your website URL
   - Note the Measurement ID (starts with "G-")

4. **Enable recommended data collection features**:
   - Enhanced measurement for events
   - User metrics reports

## Deployment Options

### Self-Hosted with Docker

Landstro includes a convenient deployment script that handles the entire process:

```bash
# Make the script executable (first time only)
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Run deployment
./deploy.sh
```

The script will:

1. Load environment variables from your `.env` file
2. Prepare your production build with `npm run prepare-prod`
3. Set up Docker containers
4. Verify SSL configuration
5. Provide status of your deployment

For manual deployment, you can also run:

```bash
# Generate production assets
npm run prepare-prod

# Deploy using Docker
cd production-build
docker-compose -f ../docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Deploying on Digital Ocean

1. **Create a Digital Ocean account**:
   - Sign up at [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
   - Add a payment method

2. **Create a new Droplet**:
   - Choose Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or the newest LTS)
   - Select a Basic plan ($5-10/month is sufficient to host several landing pages)
   - Choose a datacenter region closest to your target audience
   - Add your SSH key for secure access

3. **Connect to your Droplet**:
   ```bash
   ssh root@your-droplet-ip
   ```

   *Or just click the `console` button in your droplet page.*

4. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   apt update
   apt install -y docker.io docker-compose
   ```

5. **Configure your server**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /var/www/yourrepo # or the name of your landing page
   cd /var/www/yourrepo
   ```

6. **Copy your files to the server**:
   Using Git:
   
   ```bash
   # On your server

   # use your username and repository name here
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git .
   ```

7. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # On your server
   cp env.example .env
   nano .env  # Edit with your values
   ```

8. **Run the deployment script**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

9. **Verify deployment**:
   - Check if containers are running: `docker compose ps`
   - View logs if needed: `docker compose logs -f`

10. **Server IP**:
   - In the droplet page, you will see a number like this: `ipv4: 12.34.567.89`, save this for later

### Setting Up Cloudflare

1. **Create a Cloudflare account**:
   - Sign up at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
   - Add your domain to Cloudflare

2. **Update nameservers at your domain registrar**:
   - Find the Cloudflare nameservers provided during setup
   - Update your domain's nameservers at your registrar ([tutorial for Namecheap here](https://namecheap.pxf.io/EE2PJD))
   - Wait for DNS propagation (can take 24-48 hours, usually takes less)

3. **Configure DNS records in Cloudflare**:
   - Create an A record pointing to your server IP (the one you saw as `ipv4`):
     ```
     Type: A
     Name: @ (or the root domain itself e.g., `benav.io`)
     Content: your-server-ip (e.g., 12.34.567.89)
     Proxy status: Proxied
     ```
     
     This creates a record for your root domain (e.g., `benav.io`).
   
   - Add a CNAME record for www subdomain:
     ```
     Type: CNAME
     Name: www
     Content: your-root-domain (e.g., benav.io)
     Proxy status: Proxied
     ```
     
     This creates a record for the www version (e.g., `www.benav.io`).

4. **Enable SSL/TLS protection**:
   - Go to SSL/TLS
   - In **overview**, set SSL/TLS encryption mode to "Full (strict)"
   - In **Edge Certificates**, disable "Always Use HTTPS" (caddy will handle this)
   - Turn off "Automatic HTTPS Rewrites" (caddy also handles this)

5. **Configure Cloudflare settings**:
   - Turn on caching features appropriate for your site

6. **Verify configuration**:
   - Visit your domain to ensure it loads properly
   - Check SSL certificate is valid (look for the padlock in browser)

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Missing favicons**: Ensure your logo.png exists at `public/images/icon/logo.png`
- **Form not working**: Check that the database was properly initialized during build
- **Image optimization issues**: Ensure Sharp is installed correctly
- **Site URL issues**: Verify that the `SITE_URL` environment variable is set correctly in your `.env` file
- **Failed deployment**: Check Docker logs with `docker-compose logs -f`
- **SSL certificate issues**: Verify Cloudflare is properly configured with your domain

> **Note about image regeneration**: When changing the logo.png or other source images, the build process automatically detects changes and regenerates optimized images and favicons as needed. No manual deletion of previously generated files is required.
